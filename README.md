Compresses ALL video files in selected folder.


Videos take just too much space on my PC. There are tools like HandBrake which can deal with that, but it would take ages to put every single file in their To Do list. Luckily there is a better way. I used ffmpeg and shell to convert, trim, join, compress... videos.

After I switched to Linux from Windows 10 I found out that Free version of Davinci Resolve can't work with .mp4 files.
My second problem was that I had lot of videos on my PC (movies in DVD quality, webinars, songs, memories, funny stuff... ) I used HandBrake to reduce their size, but true power came, when I found out I can just compress whole folders with one command.
